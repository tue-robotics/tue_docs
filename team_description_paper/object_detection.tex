\subsubsection{Detection \& Segmentation}
ED enables integrating sensors through the use of the plugins present in the \textit{ed\_sensor\_integration} package. 
Two different plugins exist:
1. The \emph{laser\_plugin}: Enables tracking of 2D laser clusters. 
This plugin can be used to track dynamic obstacles such as humans.
2. The \emph{kinect\_plugin}: Enables world model updates with use of data from a RGBD camera. 
This plugin exposes several ROS services that realize different functionalities:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Segment: A service that segments sensor data that is not associated with other world model entities. 
Segmentation areas can be specified per entity in the scene. This allows to segment object `on-top-of’ or ‘in’ a cabinet. 
All points outside the segmented area are ignore for segmentation.
\item FitModel: A service that fits the specified model in the sensor data of a RGBD camara. 
This allows updating semi-static obstacles such as tables and chairs.
\end{enumerate}


The \emph{ed\_sensor\_integration} plugins enable updating and creating entities. 
However, new entities are classified as unknown entities. Classification is done in \emph{ed\_perception} plugin\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/ed_perception}} package.
