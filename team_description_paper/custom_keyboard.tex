\noindent To reduce the operator error, we only present the user with a limited number of buttons in the Telegram app using its \emph{custom\_keyboards} feature. %This feature is especially useful if there are only a few options, such as when selecting from a predetermined selection of drinks.
This feature has been employed to compose commands word-for-word. After the user has  entered a partial command, for example “Bring me the ...” they are presented with only those words that might follow that text according to the grammar, eg. “apple”, “orange” etc. This process iterates until a full command has been composed.
