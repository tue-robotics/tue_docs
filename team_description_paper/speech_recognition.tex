\label{ssec:speech_recognition}
For natural interaction using spoken commands, we use Picovoice\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/picovoice_ros}} as our \acrfull{asr} engine.
We prepare various \acrfull{fcfg} based language models for the \acrshort{asr} model, some specific to the challenges and the rest general and have developed an interface that allows lazy loading of these models in the challenges.
