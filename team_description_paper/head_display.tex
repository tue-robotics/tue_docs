For most people, especially people who do not deal with robots in their day-to-day life, interaction with robots is not as easy as one would like it to be.
% It is often difficult to hear what the robot is saying and it is not always intuitive for people to know when to talk to the robot.
To remedy this, the head display (pre-integrated in the Toyota HSRs) of HERO is used\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/hero-display}}.
By default, our Tech United @Home logo is shown on the screen, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:hero_display}. When the robot is speaking the spoken text is displayed, when the robot is listening a spinner along with an image of a microphone is shown.
It is also possible to display (live) images for various tasks.
