To perform proper speech recognition, knowing the direction of the sound is important to capture the sound source properly. We localize the sound source by determining the direction of arrival (DOA) with use of the microphones of the Matrix Creator\footnote{\url{https://creator.matrix.one}}.

The detection is done by first calculating the time cross correlation between four pairs of opposing microphones. Second, the microphone pair with the lowest phase shift w.r.t. the opposing microphone is selected as being perpendicular to the source. Finally, the direction of the source can be determined by combining this information with the energy level of the microphones. This upgrade compared to the stock DOA code of the Matrix Creator has been pushed back to their repositories. Our software for the DOA detection is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/matrix-creator-hal}}, as well as a ROS package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/matrix_creator_ros}} that exposes the DOA detections via a pose topic.
Because the DSPL doesn't allow hardware changes to the robot, this software needs to be re-implemented for the Toyota HSR.
