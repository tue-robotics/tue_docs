To perform proper speech recognition, the direction of the sound is important to capture the sound source properly. We localize the sound source by determining the direction of arrival (DOA) with use of a microphone array board with 8 microphones\footnote{\url{https://creator.matrix.one}} , depicted in Figure \ref{fig:matrix_one}.

The detection is done by first calculating the time cross correlation between four pairs of opposing microphones. Second, the microphone pair with the lowest phase shift w.r.t. opposed microphone is selected as perpendicular to the source. Finally, the direction of the source can be determined by combining this information with the energy level\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/matrix-creator-hal}} of the microphones. Our software for the DOA detection is available on github, as well as a ROS package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/matrix_creator_ros}} that exposes the DOA detections via a geometry\_msgs/PoseStamped topic interface.
