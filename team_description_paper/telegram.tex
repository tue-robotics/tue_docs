\label{ssec:telegram}
The Telegram interface\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/telegram_ros}} to our robots is a ROS wrapper around the \emph{python-telegram-bot} library. The software exposes four topics, for images and text resp. from and to the robot.
%To communicate with the robot you need to send \textit{/start}.
The interface allows only one master of the robot at a time.

%The interface itself doesn't contain any reasoning. This is all done by the \emph{conversation\_engine}, which is described in the following subsection.
