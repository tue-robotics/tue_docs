\label{ssec:telegram}
The telegram interface\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/telegram_ros}}to our robots is a ROS wrapper around the \emph{python-telegram-bot} library. The software exposes four topics. It accepts both text and images to and from the robot. To communicate with the robot you need to send \textit{/start}. As the interface allows only one master of the robot at a time.

The interface itself doesn't contain any reasoning. This is all done by the \emph{conversation\_engine}, which is described in the following subsection.
