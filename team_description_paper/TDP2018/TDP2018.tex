TODO: UPDATE \\
This paper provides an overview of the main developments of the Tech United Eindhoven RoboCup@Home team. Tech United uses an advanced world modeling representation system called the Environment Descriptor that allows straight forward implementation of localization, navigation, exploration, object detection \& recognition, object manipulation and robot-robot cooperation skills. Recent developments are improved object detection via deep learning methods, a generic GUI for different user levels, improved speech recognition, improved natural language interpretation and sound source localization.
