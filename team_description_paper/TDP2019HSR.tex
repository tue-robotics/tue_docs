\begin{abstract}
This paper provides an overview of the main developments of the Tech United Eindhoven RoboCup @Home team. Tech United uses an advanced world modeling representation system called the Environment Descriptor. It allows straightforward implementation of localization, navigation, exploration, object detection \& recognition, object manipulation and robot-robot cooperation skills based on the most recent state of the world. Recent developments are improved object and people detection via deep learning methods, a generic GUI for different user levels, improved speech recognition, improved natural language interpretation, sound source localization and the integration of a Telegram interface, combined with a conversation engine.
