The Tech United team carries out many promotional activities for children to promote technology and innovation. These activities are carried out by separate teams of student assistants. Tech United often visits primary and secondary schools, public events, trade fairs and has regular TV performances. In 2015 and 2016 combined, 100+ demos were given and an estimated 50k people were reached through live interaction.
