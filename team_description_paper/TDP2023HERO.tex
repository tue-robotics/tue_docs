\begin{abstract}
This paper provides an overview of the main developments of the Tech United Eindhoven RoboCup@Home team. Tech United uses an advanced world modeling system called the Environment Descriptor. It allows straightforward implementation of localization, navigation, exploration, object detection \& recognition, object manipulation and robot-robot cooperation skills based on the most recent state of the world. Other important features include object and people recognition via deep learning methods, a GUI \& use of HSR's display, natural language interpretation \& context-free grammar based speech recognition and a chat interface combined with a custom keyboard and conversation engine. Ongoing developments are focused on improving the perception pipelines.
