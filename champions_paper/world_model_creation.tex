A world model is described in a SDFormat file for compatibility with the Gazebo simulation engine.
Currently, world models in ED are generated in a semi-automated way by manually composing and updating multiple object models templates\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/ed_object_models}} built over the years.
New ED plugins are in works that would fully automate the updation of these templates in the future.
