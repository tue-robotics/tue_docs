\label{ssec:display}
On the display that is integrated in the Toyota HSR's 'head' a lot of useful information can be displayed. Through the \emph{hero\_ display}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/hero-display}} a few different functionalities are integrated. As per default our Tech United @home logo, \ref{fig:hero_display} is displayed on the screen. When the robot is speaking the spoken text is displayed (std\_msgs/String), when the robot is listening a spinner is shown (hmi\_msgs/GoalStatus) and next to this it is possible to display images (sensor\_msgs/Image-sensor\_msgs/CompressedImage).
