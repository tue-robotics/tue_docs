In the previous sections, we have described the various modules that contribute towards the functioning of our robots.
However, for a challenge to be successfully performed by HERO, these modules need to be strategically integrated together in context to the said challenge.
We do this by creating hierarchical state machines using SMACH\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue_robocup}}.
Over the years, we have extracted all the commonly used integrations into the modules "\emph{robot\_smach\_states}" and "\emph{robot\_skills}", and started retaining only challenge specific behaviors within the challenges.
